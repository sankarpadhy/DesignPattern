# Creational Design Patterns

This directory contains implementations of creational design patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern** (`singleton/`)
   - Ensures a class has only one instance
   - Provides a global point of access to that instance

2. **Factory Pattern** (`factory/`)
   - Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic
   - Refers to the newly created object using a common interface

3. **Abstract Factory Pattern** (`abstractfactory/`)
   - Creates families of related objects
   - Ensures created objects work together consistently

4. **Builder Pattern** (`builder/`)
   - Separates object construction from its representation
   - Same construction process can create different representations

5. **Prototype Pattern** (`prototype/`)
   - Creates new objects by cloning an existing object (prototype)
   - Avoids costly creation and provides a way to copy existing objects
