# Structural Design Patterns

This directory contains implementations of structural design patterns:

1. **Adapter Pattern** (`adapter/`)
   - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
   - Wraps an object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class

2. **Bridge Pattern** (`bridge/`)
   - Separates an abstraction from its implementation
   - Allows both to vary independently

3. **Composite Pattern** (`composite/`)
   - Composes objects into tree structures
   - Lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly

4. **Decorator Pattern** (`decorator/`)
   - Adds new responsibilities to objects dynamically
   - Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing

5. **Facade Pattern** (`facade/`)
   - Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem
   - Defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use

6. **Flyweight Pattern** (`flyweight/`)
   - Minimizes memory usage by sharing data across objects
   - Used when many similar objects need to be created

7. **Proxy Pattern** (`proxy/`)
   - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object
   - Controls access to the original object
